# NewIndigho

Revamped my music application 'IndiGho'.

Frontend is created using javascript based framework React Js with stylings done using Styled Components. 

App uses Spotify API to pull your spotfiy stats and display them through a minimalist user interface. 

Application uses OAuth2 for logging in/out provided by Spotify itself along with session storage. 

Backend functions are included in the index.js file. 

For deployment, I have used the PaaS, Heroku since it is free and I do not require additional elasticity.
